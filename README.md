### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer at [Magrathea Labs](https://magrathealabs.com/). Currently my interests are focused on developing projects oriented to the DataOps/MLOps methodologies: Airflow, Kubernetes, data pipeline tests and ci/cd applied to data projects.

I've written some articles on Medium on these topics, take a look at [my profile](https://medium.com/@marcosmarxm)
